The shutdown-command has different images and messages, depending on if Andre_601 is using the command or not.
The bot has 35 Commands. (12 in Fun, 10 in Info, 4 in NSFW, 3 in Guild and 6 in a not seen category)
GitHub saved this bot twice from being completely erased.
It took Andre_601 multiple tries and the help of 4 different devs, to get the Info-command working correctly in DM.
The Bot is used on the official nekos.life Discord.
A lot of the code is inspired by other bots.
The bot actually converts the verification levels "high" and "very_high" into their corresponding image (`(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻` and `┻━┻ ミ ヽ(ಠ益ಠ)ﾉ 彡 ┻━┻`)
This is actually just a random message... because why not :P
