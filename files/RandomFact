The shutdown-command has different images and messages, depending on if Andre_601 is using the command or not.
The bot has 32 Commands. (11 in Fun, 9 in Info, 3 in NSFW, 3 in Guild and 6 in a not seen category)
GitHub literally saved this bot. Without it, the code would be gone!
It took Andre_601 multiple tries and the help of 4 different devs, to get the Info-command working correctly in DM.
The Bot is used on the official nekos.life Discord.
Some code of the Bot is inspired by other bots (PowerSuggestion, FlareBot, NekoBeta) and a Spigot-plugin (DiscordSRV)
The bot actually converts the verification levels "high" and "very_high" into their corresponding image (`(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻` and `┻━┻ ミ ヽ(ಠ益ಠ)ﾉ 彡 ┻━┻`)
When Andre_601 wouldn't be that lazy, then the version would be much higher
This is actually just a random message... because why not :P
