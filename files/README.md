## Commiting own text
You're free to commit own messages to the file, with the exceptions of the following ones:
- [BlacklistedGuilds](/files/BlacklistedGuilds)
- [RandomFact](/files/RandomFact)
- [welcome-images](/files/welcome-images)

You should also follow the style of the messages (Like f.e. keeping the same amount of placeholders (`%s`) in the messages).  
It needs to be 1 message per line and empty lines aren't allowed.

If a file has the name `image` in it, does that mean, that you're only allowed to have image-links in it.  
And there are also certain conditions to the images:
- RandomShutdownImage needs to be images of nekos that are sleeping (or at least look like they go to sleep)
- RandomKissImage needs to be images of two women kissing (Since it's a response for a certain person)
- RandomNoShutdownImage has to be images of nekos (or similar) that look scared/sad.
